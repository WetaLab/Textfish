`textfish` is a bot that analyses texting interactions using chess terms and icons using AI. The name is a parody of the software "Stockfish".

`textfish` analyzes images of text conversations, generates a stylized review image, and posts a detailed "Game Review" message. It leverages Google Gemini for AI analysis and a custom renderer for visuals.

## Examples
